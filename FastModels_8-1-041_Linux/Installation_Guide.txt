How to set up Fast Models 8.1
==============================================================================

This is a quick start guide to install and setup the tools and the model
library.

Detailed documentation can be found in 'doc' subfolder for Fast Model 
Tools and the 'Docs' subfolder for the Fast Model Portfolio.

---------------------------------
Platform requirements for Windows
---------------------------------

When running Microsoft Windows XP or Microsoft Windows 7 it is
recommended to use machines with at least 2GB RAM, and preferably at
least 4GB for best performance. To use audio a 2GHz, or faster, Intel
Core2Duo, or similar performing, processor is recommended.

Operating system:
Microsoft Windows XP 32 Bit SP2 or SP3.
Microsoft Windows 7 32 bit RTM or SP1, Professional or Enterprise editions.
Microsoft Windows 7 64 bit RTM or SP1, Professional or Enterprise editions.

Compiler:

Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 with Service Pack 1 and the Microsoft
Visual Studio 2008 Service Pack 1 ATL Security Update.

or

Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 with Service Pack 1.

Runtime Libraries:
Fast Models Portfolio does not contain the Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 SP1 
or Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 SP1 runtime libraries.

Models built with Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 SP1 or Microsoft Visual
Studio 2010 SP1 require both the Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 SP1 and
the Microsoft Visual Studio 2008/2010 SP1 Redistributable Package to
be installed in order to run.

Please email support-esl@arm.com with any comments.

To view the documentation, Adobe Acrobat reader (Version 8 or higher)
needs to be installed on the system.


-------------------------------
Platform requirements for Linux
-------------------------------

When running on Linux it is recommended to use machines with at least 2GB RAM,
and preferably at least 4GB for best performance. To use audio a 2GHz, or
faster, Intel Core2Duo, or similar performing, processor is recommended.

Operating system:
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 (on either 32 or 64 bit architecture)
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (on either 32 or 64 bit architecture)
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (on either 32 or 64 bit architecture)

Compiler:

When building models for 32bit hosts, Fast Models 8.1 for Linux
supports the following compilers:
 - gcc 4.1.2 (built against at least binutils 2.17)
 - gcc 4.4.4

When building models for 64bit hosts, Fast Models 8.1 for Linux
supports the following compiler:
 - gcc 4.1.2 (built against at least binutils 2.17)
 - gcc 4.4.4

To view the documentation, Adobe Acrobat reader (Version 8 or higher) needs to
be installed on the system.


----------------------
A) Install Fast Models
----------------------
Prerequisites:
- You have the current Fast Models installation package
  I.e. FastModels_8-1-0XX_Linux.tgz (Linux) or
       FastModels_8-1-0XX_Win32.zip (Win32)

Note: Japanese or Korean characters must not be used in installation or 
project file paths, as they can cause corrupted installations or failure
to find the specified libraries.

1. On Linux, unpack the installation package into a temporary location. The
   installation package is unpacked to a pre-defined directory 
   (FastModels_8-1-0XX_Linux).

   On Windows the product can normally be installed directly from the
   archive if the unarchiving tool being used supports this functionality. 
   If it does not the installation package will need to be unpacked manually.
   It will unpack it into the selected working directory.
   
2. Change to the appropriate directory (on Linux: FastModels_8-1-0XX_Linux)
   and execute ./setup.bin (Linux) or Setup.exe (Win32) 

3. The installer window will appear. Follow the installation procedure.

4. Linux only: To setup the environment, the appropriate setup script 
   must be sourced:
       bash:   source etc/setup_all.sh
       csh:    source etc/setup_all.csh
 
   You may wish to add this to your shell initialization files; otherwise
   the setup script must be sourced at the start of each session.

--------------------------------------------
B) Install Third Party IP add-ons (optional)
--------------------------------------------

The Third Party IP add-ons package provides example code and binaries
that contain Third-Party IP. It also contains SystemC and TLM header files 
and binaries for building EVS (SystemC Export), and support packages
for allowing models access to the external network. 

Please note that you can also use your own OSCI SystemC and TLM
packages. The SystemC export examples delivered with Fast Models rely
on a directory structure which might differ to the structure of your
OSCI packages. You either need to adapt the examples or apply the
patch present in the TPIP package to your OSCI packages.
 
 Prerequisites:
- You have the latest Third Party IP add-ons package
  I.e. FastModels_ThirdParty_IP_8-1_bXX_Linux.tgz (Linux) or
  FastModels_ThirdParty_IP_8-1_bXX_Win32.zip (Windows)
  (You can download the package from the same location as the Fast Models
  package)

1. Unpack the installation package in a temporary location

2. Execute the command ./setup.bin (Linux) or Setup.exe (Win32), and 
   follow the installation instructions. 
   It is recommended to choose the same installation directory used for
   the ARM Fast Models PV Model Library.

----------------------------
Licence management utilities
----------------------------

If you are using floating licenses, you must use FLEXnet license
management utilities version 9.2 or higher. FLEXnet 10.8 license
management utilities are available as an optional installable
component in the product installer.

Use the highest version of the license management utilities provided with
any ARM tools you are using. It is recommended to setup the user
environment running applications of the Fast Models product only for one
armlmd license server, because spreading Fast Models license features
over different servers could result in license denials for certain features.

For more instructions on installing licenses please consult the ARM
online documentation:

----------------------------
Known limitations on Windows
----------------------------

- Do not use an installation path that is longer than 255 characters.
  This is a limitation of the Windows host operating system.
- The installation path which is used to set MAXCORE_HOME/MAXVIEW_HOME 
  environment variables and the paths to SimGen and ModelDebugger cannot 
  be set to an UNC path. A path containing a drive letter  must be used 
  instead (can be achieved by mapping the UNC path to a drive).
- If Visual Studio is installed properly, System Generator automatically
  locates devenv by checking the environment variable VS80COMNTOOLS for
  Visual Studio 2008. If the path to the appropriate devenv cannot
  be determined, building the model is not possible. If there are problems
  with the automatic mechanism, or to select a different version of this 
  tool, after installing start sgcanvas, select Preferences from the File 
  menu and enter the path to devenv from the Applications page. You can
  specify different paths for Visual Studio 2008 and 2010 to enable either 
  version of the tool to be used depending on the project settings.
