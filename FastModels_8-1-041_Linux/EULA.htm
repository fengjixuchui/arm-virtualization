SEATS, INSTALLATION AND LICENCE KEYS: Your use of the Software is limited to the
specific number of Seats issued to you by ARM. For each Seat, ARM will make a Licence
Key available to you to enable use of the Software, or certain components or optional
functionality in the Software, as applicable. You shall only install and use the
Software and Licence Keys on computers, or virtual machines running on computers,
which are owned by you (or which are in your exclusive possession under an equipment
finance arrangement) and which are either: (i) located at your premises; or (ii)
portable computers which shall remain in the possession and control of your employees
when outside such premises.

In respect of; (i) a node locked licence, each Seat and Licence Key shall be restricted
to use by a single person at any one time and limited or locked to a single item
of your computer hardware (also known as host ID) on which the Seat or Licence Key
is initially installed; and (ii) in respect of a floating licence, each Seat and
Licence Key shall be limited or controlled by a licence server shared by multiple
computers so that one authorised Licence Key is required for each simulation process
concurrently using the relevant Software, except where ARM may separately agree to
authorise the transfer (also known as re-hosting) of a Seat or Licence Key.

at your premises; (ii) comply with the terms of this Licence; (iii) are contractually
obligated to use the Software only for your benefit, and (iv) agree to assign all
their work product and any rights they create therein in the supply of such work
to you. Only the single individual, company or other legal entity to whom ARM is
supplying this Licence may use the Software and Licence Keys. Except as provided
in this clause, you shall not allow third parties (including but not limited to any
