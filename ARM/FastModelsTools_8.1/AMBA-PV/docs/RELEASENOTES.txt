Release Notes for AMBA-PV release 1.7
=====================================

This is the release 1.7 of AMBA-PV.

AMBA-PV provides a mapping of AMBA buses on top of TLM:

- Dedicated to Programmer's View (PV), it focuses on high-level,
  functionally accurate, transaction modeling. Low-level signals such as, for
  example, channel handshake, are not important at that level. 

- Standard for modeling of AMBA ACE, AXI, AHB and APB buses with TLM.

- Targeted at Loosely-Timed (LT) coding style of Accellera Systems Initiative
  (ASI) TLM, it includes blocking transport, Direct Memory Interface (DMI), and
  debug interfaces.

- Interoperable, it allows models using the mapped AMBA buses to work
  in an IEEE-compliant SystemC environment.

AMBA-PV extensions to the TLM Base Protocol (BP) cover the following:

- definition of AMBA-PV extension and traits classes
- specialisation of TLM sockets and interfaces
- use of TLM b_transport() blocking transport interface only. 

In addition, AMBA-PV defines class and interfaces for the modeling of side-band
signals such as, for example, interrupts.

1) Software requirements
========================

Supported SystemC version is 2.2.0, 14-Mar-2007.
Supported TLM version is 2.0.1, 15-Jul-2009.
This release is supported on the following platforms:

- Linux Red Hat Enterprise 4 Update 4 (32 or 64 bit) with GNU C++ compiler 4.1.2

- Linux Red Hat Enterprise 5 (32 or 64 bit) with GNU C++ compiler 4.1.2 or 4.4.4

- Windows XP SP2 or SP3 (32 bit) with Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 (aka MSVC++
  9.0)

- Windows 7 RTM or SP1 (32 or 64 bit) with Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1
  (aka MSVC++ 9.0) or 2010 SP1 (aka MSVC++ 10.0).

This 1.7 release is not, nor was it intended to be, backward compatible
with previous releases.

The current implementation of AMBA-PV sockets makes use of ASI TLM simple
sockets. Hence, when compiling applications that use AMBA-PV sockets with
ASI SystemC, it is necessary to define the macro SC_INCLUDE_DYNAMIC_PROCESSES
before including the SystemC header file.

When creating applications on Windows, the /vmg option must be added in the
Microsoft Visual C++ project settings to correctly compile source code for use
with SystemC.

When creating applications on Windows, you may see messages like this:
  "Unknown compiler version - please run the configure tests and report the
  results"
This is issued by the Boost library, which is used by ASI SystemC code.
It can be safely ignored.


2) Package contents
===================

This package contains AMBA-PV 1.7 extensions to TLM. The package has the
following directory structure:

  docs      * Contains these release notes and the Developer Guide
              documentation.

  docs/html * Contains the Doxygen-generated Reference Manual documentation.

  examples  * Provides example platforms (assembly of models communicating via
              AMBA-PV). See the README.txt provided with each example for more
              information.

  include   * Contains the definition of AMBA-PV extensions to TLM interfaces
              and classes.


3) Building the examples
========================

To build the examples, the SYSTEMC_HOME environment variable must be set to
point to the root of your SystemC 2.2.0 installation. Additionally the
TLM_HOME variable must be set to point to the root of your TLM 2.0.1
installation.


4) What's new in this release?
==============================

Compared to the previous release, this release has the following new items:

- Bug fixes and enhancements, see section 5 below.


5) Bug fixes and enhancements
=============================

This release contains the following bug fixes and enhancements:

- Adjust DMI range to the slave mapped range in amba_pv_decoder, amba_pv_memory,
  and amba_pv_simple_memory classes, get_direct_mem_ptr() method, when denying
  DMI access.

- Added set_id_shift() and get_id_shift() methods to amba_pv_decoder class,
  enabling to set and retrieve the shift value used in updating the transaction
  ID to ensure its uniqueness before forwarding the transaction throught to the
  addressed slave. When the shift value is set to zero, the transaction ID will
  not be updated.

- Added support for transaction's addresses greater than 32-bit in the
  amba_pv_address() function.

- Updated amba_pv_simple_probe class to use SC_REPORT_INFO() for printing
  transactions rather than just std::cout.


6) New features
===============

This release contains the following new features:

- Addition of TLM extended full-duplex interfaces and sockets for enhanced ACE
  mapping on TLM 2.0. See directory include/tlmx for more details.

- Hierarchical binding support is available when using the following interfaces
  and classes:
  o ext::amba_pv_fw_transport_if
  o ext::amba_pv_bw_transport_if
  o ext::amba_pv_ace_bw_transport_if
  o ext::amba_pv_master_socket
  o ext::amba_pv_slave_socket
  o ext::amba_pv_ace_master_socket
  o ext::amba_pv_ace_slave_socket
  o ext::amba_pv_master_base
  o ext::amba_pv_slave_base
  o ext::amba_pv_ace_master_base
  o ext::amba_pv_ace_slave_base
  Those classes and interfaces are defined in the ext sub-namespace of the
  amba_pv one. They will move into the amba_pv namepsace and replace the
  current ones in a future release.
  When unsing one of ext::amba_pv_master_socket, ext::amba_pv_ace_master_socket,
  the socket must be bound to the corresponding backward interface. The classes
  ext::amba_pv_master_base and ext::amba_pc_ace_master_base provide with default
  implementations of those interfaces.


7) Incompatibilities with previous releases
===========================================

This release has the following incompatibilities with previous releases:


8) Known problems
=================

This release contains the following known problems:

- When translating TLM Base Protocol (BP) transactions into AMBA-PV ones in the
  amba_pv_from_tlm_bridge class, the following rules apply:
  o the address attribute must be aligned to the bus length for burst
    transactions and to the data length for single transactions
  o the data length attribute must be a multiple of the bus length for burst
    transactions
  o the streaming width attribute must be equal to the bus length for fixed
    burst transactions
  o the byte enable pointer attribute must be NULL on read transactions
  o the byte enable length attribute must be equal to the bus length for
    single write transactions and a multiple of the bus length for burst write
    transactions
  An error response is returned otherwise.

- When enabling DMI for amba_pv_exclusive_monitor, the onus is on the master
  to not use DMI for exclusive accesses. When the master uses DMI for exclusive
  accesses, wrong behavior might be observed.

- Note that ASI SystemC 2.2.0 is not supported on Windows 64-bit hosts.
