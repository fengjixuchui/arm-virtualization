----------------------------
Licence management utilities
----------------------------

If you are using floating licenses, you must use FLEXnet license
management utilities version 9.2 or higher. FLEXnet 10.8 license
management utilities are available as an optional installable
component in the product installer.

Use the highest version of the license management utilities provided with
any ARM tools you are using. It is recommended to setup the user
environment running applications of the Fast Models product only for one
armlmd license server, because spreading Fast Models license features
over different servers could result in license denials for certain features.

For more instructions on installing licenses please consult the ARM
online documentation:

Outstanding Issues
------------------

* Model Debugger can start an isim system or SystemC simulation and
  connect to it automatically. Feature can be used from GUI, command
  line and script. (DE 718484 and DE 717307).

* Model Debugger has improved behavior when MP stepping when support
  in model is provided (DE 688518).

* ModelDebugger cannot load 64-bit CADI libraries (SDDKW-10292).

* Model Debugger fails to show the model configuration dialog box when
  loading 64 bit models (SDDKW-11267).

* The ModelDebugger MxScript Sleep function was waiting for n
  milliseconds instead of n seconds on Windows. This has been
  corrected to match the manual (SDDKW-12746).
